<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJVZE-yg6ykADrM4qb0WHJAp37--rIkCw&amp;si=umcmGe9XemprzSjy">Country Store walkthrough videos</a>
and build upon my version of the country store. This article will not be a guide but rather an
explanation of the process through the perspective of the builder and some insights to ensure
that your process of building your country store goes smoothly.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: While it is not required, it is recommended to install and use
<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install">Windows WSL</a>
during the walkthrough for a smoother experience.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-adding-images-and-admin-panel">Part 2: Adding Images and Admin Panel</h2>

<p>Part 2 focuses on two things: adding real images to your store and a real admin
panel to your FastAPI app.</p>

<p>In the first part of the guide, the walkthrough demonstrates hardcoding the
image into the Food class.</p>

<p>What is a class, you may ask. Think of a car. All instances of the car class share the same
attributes: car model, car brand, mileage, and age. When you buy a car from the dealer,
you have your very own car instance. It has its own model, brand, mileage, and age.
Similarity, all Food instances in this program share the same attributes.</p>

<p>Before, each Food instance knew its id, name, and description.</p>

<p>Did it click? We’re adding the image attribute to the car class. Each Food instance will
now possess an image to display on the country store.</p>

<p>This can be found in step 1 of <a href="https://fastopp.hashnode.dev/build-a-database-driven-country-store-with-images-admin-and-fastapi-parts-23">Build a database-driven country store with images, admin,
and FastAPI (Parts 2-3)</a> on hashnode and around 1:20 in <a href="https://youtu.be/NeYBDNiLpHc">FastOpp Country Store 1.2 - Static
Images and SQLAdmin Setup with FastAPI on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>It looks something like this:</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">models.py</code>:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">class Food(SQLModel, table=True):</code></p>

<p>Key points:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image_url</code> is an optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code>, so it can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> when no image is available.</li>
  <li>The field is nullable in the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>I already had <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Food</code> defined without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image_url</code>, so I was just adding a new column here.</p>

<p>Before moving on, it’s recommended to store your food images in a designated folder
located inside the images folder found inside the static folder.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">… static/images/&lt;your folder&gt;</code></p>

<p>Now, we assign specific images to its designated food (Article Step 3, Video 3:30).</p>

<p>In routes/pages.py, find your list of foods which looks like this:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foods: list[Food] = [</code></p>

<p>After <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">description= "...."</code>, adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image_url="&lt;image url&gt;"</code> tells each food object
what image it’s assigned to, similar to a video game character learning a new spell.</p>

<p>It should now look like this:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foods: list[Food] = [</code></p>

<p>The walkthrough then goes through styling the image using Tailwind which you can do and
customize on your own (not covered in this blogpost).</p>

<p>The final step of Part 2 (Article step 6, Video 9:20) focuses on modifying and adding
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FoodAdmin</code> class to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pages.py</code>.</p>

<p>This is a significant step in building the country store because it adds the functionality
of adding new foods and their attributes (description, image, etc.) through
the UI in the admin panel. This is much easier and user friendly compared
to adding new foods through VSCode every single time.</p>

<h2 id="part-3---connect-python-data-model-to-sql-database">Part 3 - Connect Python Data Model to SQL Database</h2>

<p>Part 3 focuses on connecting the store to a database so that new entries of food from the
UI can actually be saved.</p>

<p>Before you begin, make sure you have all your foods in the database (added
through the UI, not the code) and to delete all the hardcoded foods in pages.py.</p>

<p>When completing Part 3, make sure to follow the instructions exactly. Both the
article and the video give clear instructions which made it easy for me to integrate
a database. (Article Step 8, <a href="https://youtu.be/YG7fkmdMdIU">Video</a> 1:20 onward).</p>

<p>Great! Let’s see if we can add a new food entry to our website WITHOUT hardcoding it.</p>

<p>Browse to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code> or the admin panel</p>

<p>Log in using the default credentials</p>

<p>Add or edit FOOD entries. Note: make sure the image url is inside the specified path file.</p>

<p>Visit your store in another tab.</p>

<p>If done correctly, you should see your newly added food entry! Isn’t this so much more convenient?!</p>

<h2 id="part-4---changing-favicon">Part 4 - Changing favicon</h2>

<p>Finally, we conclude by changing the Favicon.</p>

<p>What is Favicon? Do you see the small logo at the top left of your browser tab? That’s
your Favicon. Right now, it should be defaulted to OPPKEY’s favicon.</p>

<p>Open your static folder and delete the current favicon. If the folder is opened in VSCode,
the favicon should have a star logo on its left.</p>

<p>Go to favicon.io and press the green square (“PNG → ICO”).</p>

<p>Drag and drop your desired favicon.</p>

<p>Download the folder (may be automatic) and extract the folder.</p>

<p>Drag the favicon into the static folder.</p>

<p>Refresh your country store.</p>

<p>Note: If it still shows the old favicon, press CTRL + Shift + R. This will clear the browser
cache, updating the country store favicon. I personally ran into this problem and this solution worked for me.</p>

<p>And done! Your store looks amazing with added functionality!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I personally had a good experience following the walkthroughs and developing my own country store.
The instructions were clear and simple for me to follow and it’s pretty awesome to
see so many modern APIs and code segments coming together to power this functional store.
I am excited to continue improving and integrating more tools to my country store.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ethan Kim</name></author><category term="python," /><category term="class," /><category term="model," /><category term="SQL" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explanation of classes and data models for interaction with an SQL database.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/assets/images/2025_12/ethan_screenshot.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/assets/images/2025_12/ethan_screenshot.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Why I Replaced pip, Black, Flake8, and isort with Two Modern Python Tools (2026)</title><link href="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/2025/10/27/python-development-environment/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Why I Replaced pip, Black, Flake8, and isort with Two Modern Python Tools (2026)" /><published>2025-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/2025/10/27/python-development-environment</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/2025/10/27/python-development-environment/"><![CDATA[<p>The Python community is changing faster today than at any

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I’m creating this Python workflow while working on <a href="https://github.com/Oppkey/fastopp">FastOpp</a>,
a FastAPI starter for students building AI web applications. If you want to practice these
modern Python tools yourself, FastOpp is built with uv and ruff from the ground up.</p>

<p>For the past year, I knew my editor configuration was not optimal.
I just ignored digging into
the setup despite Cursor’s annoying message to
use Anysphere Python instead of the proven and stable Pylance language server.
It was more fun to write Python code than to edit the configuration files
for Python tools. Additionally, a quick assessment months ago, showed me
that Pylance was better than Anysphere Python.</p>

<p>I like the Cursor editor and plan to stick with it in 2026. Since Cursor is committed
to Anysphere Python, I decided
to give it a try. Once I opened the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings.json</code> file, I realized that
there were a lot more improvements that could make my life more fun.</p>

<h2 id="pip-versus-uv">pip versus uv</h2>

<p>pip (and later <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipenv</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">poetry</code>) used to manage my dependencies.
They worked, but installation speed and dependency resolution were slow — especially in large projects.</p>

<p>uv, from Astral (the team behind Ruff), replaces pip and virtualenv entirely.
It’s a single Rust binary that can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create virtual environments instantly,</li>
  <li>install packages in parallel,</li>
  <li>resolve dependencies deterministically,</li>
  <li>manage Python versions transparently,</li>
  <li>publish packages to PyPI with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv build</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv publish</code>,</li>
  <li>and manage different Python versions with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv install --python &lt;version&gt;</code> and works well with pyenv,</li>
</ul>

<p>Typical workflow:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>uv init myproject
uv add fastapi
uv run fastapi dev
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s drop-in compatible with pip but 10 to 100× faster.</p>

<p>One major advantage of uv is its native support for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyproject.toml</code>, Python’s modern standard for project configuration.
Unlike pip, which primarily uses separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requirements.txt</code> files for dependency management (leading to inconsistent setups across projects), uv encourages using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyproject.toml</code> for everything:
dependency management, build configuration, and tool settings.
This single file approach provides consistency across projects and makes configuration management much simpler.</p>

<h2 id="python-black-formatter-versus-ruff-formatter">Python Black Formatter versus Ruff Formatter</h2>

<p>Black was my code formatter — it enforced consistent indentation, spacing, and line length.
Ruff now includes a Black-compatible formatter built in:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruff format <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s fully compatible with Black’s style (the “one true way” of formatting Python) but runs instantly, thanks to Rust.</p>

<p>I removed the Black formatter extension in Cursor and set Ruff as my default formatter in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings.json</code>.</p>

<h2 id="optimzing-a-pyprojecttoml-template-for-ruff">Optimzing a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyproject.toml</code> Template for ruff</h2>

<p>I’ve created a reusable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyproject.toml</code> that preloads my Ruff configuration.
Since uv doesn’t yet have a template command, I copy this file manually into new projects.
It defines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>line length</li>
  <li>rule families (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">F</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIM</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C4</code>)</li>
  <li>formatting and import-sorting behavior</li>
</ul>

<p>Example snippet:</p>

<div class="language-toml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">[tool.ruff]</span>
<span class="py">line-length</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">120</span>
<span class="py">select</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"E"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"F"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"I"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"B"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"UP"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"SIM"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"C4"</span><span class="p">]</span>

<span class="py">indent-style</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"space"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I just run:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>uv <span class="nb">sync</span> <span class="nt">--dev</span>
ruff check <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">--fix</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I keep the file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/Users/craig/.config/uv/templates/ruff/pyproject.toml</code>.</p>

<p>To use it, I do:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>uv init my_project
<span class="nb">cd </span>my_project
<span class="nb">cp</span> ~/.config/uv/templates/ruff/pyproject.toml <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Hopefully, uv will add the ability to start a new project with a template in future.</p>

<h2 id="flake8-versus-ruff">Flake8 versus Ruff</h2>

<p>Flake8 was my linter for over a decade. It’s great.
It runs static checks (E, F, W codes) to catch style issues, undefined variables, and logical mistakes.
Flake8 can be extended with plugins like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flake8-bugbear</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flake8-comprehensions</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flake8-docstrings</code>.</p>

<p>The downside?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dozens of small Python plugins to install</li>
  <li>Slow runtime on large projects</li>
  <li>No auto-fix</li>
</ul>

<p>Ruff, written in Rust, replaces all of that in one binary.
It implements nearly all Flake8 plugins natively — <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code> for bugbear, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C4</code> for comprehensions, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UP</code> for pyupgrade, and more.
It’s 100× faster and can fix issues automatically:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruff check <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">--fix</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I uninstalled Flake8 and now rely entirely on Ruff for linting. Similar to leaving Pylance,
it’s a bit sad to move off old tools. However, I’m excited to really focus on the new tools
and learn more about the capability of ruff over time.</p>

<h2 id="from-isort-to-ruffs-built-in-import-sorter">From isort to Ruff’s built-in import sorter</h2>

<p>isort automatically groups and alphabetizes imports:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># before
</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">os</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">requests</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># after
</span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sys</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">requests</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ruff re-implements isort’s logic internally — same rules, same grouping, same configuration style.
By enabling Ruff’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"I"</code> rule family (and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[tool.ruff.isort]</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pyproject.toml</code>), imports are fixed automatically during linting:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ruff check <span class="nb">.</span> <span class="nt">--fix</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That means no need for a separate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isort</code> install or pre-commit hook. I uninstalled the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort">isort VSCode extension</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pylance-versus-anysphere-python">Pylance versus Anysphere Python</h2>

<p>Pylance is Microsoft’s language server for Python — the component that powers IntelliSense in VS Code.
It provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>autocompletion,</li>
  <li>type inference,</li>
  <li>inline documentation,</li>
  <li>“go to definition” navigation,</li>
  <li>and static type checking (via Pyright under the hood).</li>
</ul>

<p>Although Pylance is superior to Anysphere Python, I switched to Anysphere Python and
replaced Pylance as the language server.
In actual use, the advantages of Anysphere Python over Pylance are not immediately obvious. However, I’m
hoping it will get better in 2026. I made the switch at the end of 2025 because Anysphere Python
may have better context-aware code generating and editing in the future.
As I’ve started to use the Cursor Plan mode, I’m hoping that Anysphere Python
will help. In Cursor, I uninstalled the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance">Pylance extension</a>.</p>

<p>Switching from Pylance to Anysphere Python is the most controversial change I made.
Dumping pip, flake8, isort, and Black formatter are not as controversial because uv and
ruff are superior to the older tools.</p>

<h2 id="improving-cursor-settingsjson-for-python-in-2026">Improving Cursor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">settings.json</code> for Python in 2026</h2>

<p>Finally, I updated my editor configuration (settings.json) to remove old formatters and linters and point to Ruff as the default Python formatter.</p>

<p>I’ll include those specific settings in the blog itself, but here’s the key line:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nl">"[python]"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

<p>I am still using the prettier formatter for other languages such as HTML,
JavaScript, CSS, Markdown. I’m only using
ruff as the formatter for Python. Additionally, I have old Dart settings
that I need to review and potentially improve. I intend to use
Dart with Flutter to build frontend examples for FastOpp.</p>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<p>After switching:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No more managing 4+ Python tools</li>
  <li>No redundant dependencies</li>
  <li>Instant linting, formatting, and import cleanup</li>
  <li>uv replaces pip + venv, faster and cleaner</li>
  <li>Cursor’s AI works directly with my Python environment (via Anysphere)</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything just feels faster — from creating projects to saving files.</p>

<h2 id="try-this-setup-with-fastopp">Try this setup with FastOpp</h2>

<p>FastOpp is perfect for learning modern Python development patterns.</p>

<p>The tooling and flow was built and tested with FastOpp.</p>

<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>

<p>The Python ecosystem has evolved dramatically — the new Rust-based tooling from Astral (Ruff, uv) makes Python development feel fast. I saw an interview of one of the
founders of Anysphere, the makers of Cursor. He said that
they wanted to make development fun and that fast was fun.
I agree with this. Speed and the quest for efficiency
are really powerful ways to make life more fun.
Additionally, I removed almost a dozen Python-only dependencies and simplified my workflow to just Ruff + uv.</p>

<p>After years of working from the comfort of Python and Django,
I moved to the wild asynchronous world of FastAPI to improve
latency in web-based AI applications. I started with FastAPI
and built an open source stack called <a href="https://github.com/Oppkey/fastopp">FastOpp</a> which adds command line and web tools similar to Django.</p>

<p>Initially, things with smoothly using SQLite and
<a href="https://github.com/omnilib/aiosqlite">aiosqlite</a> to add
AsyncIO to SQLite. I used <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> as my Object Relational
Mapper (ORM) and Alembic as the database migration tool. Everything
seemed to work easily, so I added a Python script to make things
similar to Django’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">migrate.py</code>.</p>

<p>As things were going smoothly, I added <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">Pydantic</a> for data validation and
connected Pydantic to the SQLAlchemy models with <a href="https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/">SQLModel</a>.
Although I was pulling in open source packages that I wasn’t that familiar with, the packages
were popular and I didn’t have problems during initial use.</p>

<p>Django comes with an opinated stack of stable, time-tested tools, which I was
started to miss. However, in order to give
FastAPI a proper assessment, I continued forward by integrating
<a href="https://github.com/aminalaee/sqladmin">SQLAdmin</a>
for a pre-configured web admin panel for SQLAlchemy.</p>

<p>I also implemented <a href="https://github.com/fastapi-users/fastapi-users">FastAPIUsers</a>.
At this point, I started to miss Django even more as I needed to implement my own
JWT authentication, using FastAPIUsers as the hash mechanism.
The FastAPI project has a <a href="https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template">full-stack-fastapi-template</a>
that might have been a better starting point.</p>

<p>I chose not to use it since my primary goal was focused on using Jinja2
templates for a streaming application from an LLM. This would provide a more Django-like experience
for FastAPI and provide the opportunity in the future to use the built-in API and auto-documentation
of FastAPI instead of implementing something like Django REST framework.</p>

<p>The obvious question is whether it’s better to just use Django from the beginning and
not build a Django-like interface around FastAPI. The primary motivation occurred when I was using Django for asynchronous communication with LLM endpoints. Although Django works fine with
asynchronous communication, because its default communication style is synchronous,
it created a number of problems for me. For most average people like me, it’s going
to be difficult to keep a method asynchronous and not have any
synchronous calls in it to other libraries that might be synchronous or
other synchronous communication channels like a database access.</p>

<p>At this point, I had already committed to FastAPI and making things asynchronous.
I thought I just needed to use an asynchronous driver with PostgresSQL
and everything would work.</p>

<p>I was wrong.</p>

<h2 id="problems-moving-to-asynchronous-database-connections-psycopg2-psycopg3-or-asyncpg">Problems Moving to Asynchronous Database Connections psycopg2, psycopg3 or asyncpg</h2>

<p>The default way to connect to Python for many people is psycopg2.
This is a very proven way.  It is the default usage in most Django applications.
Unfortunately, it is synchronous. The most common asynchronous PostgresSQL connector is asyncpg.
Initially, I used psycopg2 and rewrote the database connection to be synchronous and 
have everything around the connection be asynchronous. 
As the latency with the LLM is much higher than the latency with the database,
this seemed like a reasonable solution at the time.  I just had to await
for the database to send me back the response and then I was free to deal
with other asynchronous problems such as LLM query and Internet search
status updates.</p>

<p>This is great in theory and I’m sure that other more experienced Python
developers can easily solve this problem and keep the synchronous and asynchronous
code nicely separated with clean use of async and await.</p>

<p>However, I ran into problems with organizing my code to be synchronous
connections to the database within asynchronous methods that were talking
to the LLM and storing the history in the database.</p>

<p>As I was familiar with async/await from using Dart for many years,
I was pretty surprised I was having these problems.  The problem
I had might have been due to my lack of experience understanding
which pre-made Python modules were sending back synchronous versus asynchronous responses.</p>

<p>I think that other Python developers might be able to understand my pain.</p>

<p>To keep to an asynchronous database connection for both SQLite and PostgresSQL,
I moved to asyncpg.</p>

<h2 id="ssl-security-not-needed-in-sqlite-but-needed-in-postgressql-production">SSL Security Not Needed in SQLite, But Needed in PostgresSQL Production</h2>

<p>The asyncpg connector worked fine in development but not in production.</p>

<p>Although establishing an SSL network connection seems obvious, I didn’t really appreciate this because
I had been deploying to sites like Fly.io, Railway and DigitalOcean Droplets with SQLite.
For small prototype applications, SQLite works surprisingly well with FastAPI.
I was trying to deploy to the free version, hobby tier, of Leapcell to set up a
tutorial for students who didn’t want to pay or didn’t want to put their
credit card into a hosting service.</p>

<p>There’s no way to write to the project file system on Leapcell.
They do offer a free tier that is pretty generous for PostgresSQL.
They require SSL communication between the PostgresSQL database and their engine,
which they call the service.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the syntax is different for the SSL mode between psycopg2
and asyncpg.  I couldn’t just add sslmode=require to the end of the connection URL.</p>

<p>Leapcell did not have an example for asyncpg. Likely due to my limited skills, I wasn’t able to modify my application completely enough to put the SSL connections in all the required places.</p>

<p>In order to just use the URL connection point with sslmode=require, I decided
to use psycopg3.</p>

<h2 id="prepared-statements-caused-application-to-crash-with-sqlalchemy">Prepared Statements Caused Application to Crash With SQLAlchemy</h2>

<p>As I was trying to use an async ORM, I used SQLAlchemy. I
didn’t have too much experience with it initially. I didn’t realize that
even though I wasn’t making prepared statements in my Python application,
the communication process between psycopg and PostgresSQL was storing
prepared statements.</p>

<p>Due to the way the connections were pooled on Leapcell, I had to disable the
prepared statements.  It took me a while to isolate the problem and
then implement the fix.</p>

<p>The problem never occurred when using SQLite because SQLite runs prepared statements
in the same process using the same memory space as the Python program.
This is different from PostgreSQL where the network and session state can change.</p>

<p>As I was worried about the performance impact, I did some research and it does appear that
SQLAlchemy already does statement caching on the Python side.</p>

<p>The real world impact of disabling the prepared statement in PostgreSQL
appears to be negligible.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Using SQLite in asynchronous mode has been quite easy.  Getting PostgresSQL to work has been more difficult.
There were three areas that I had trouble with for PostgresSQL:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Asynchronous connection. How write asynchronous Python code effectively to await the return data.</li>
  <li>Security. How to deal with both SQLite that doesn’t require a SSL and PostgresSQL in production that does require a SSL.</li>
  <li>Prepared statements. I needed to learn to rely on the SQLAlchemy statement caching instead of the built-in prepared statements on the PostgresSQL server.</li>
</ol>

<p>I like FastAPI and there are many huge advantages to using it that I got in the first hour of use.
I’m going to continue using it instead of Django.  However, I’m starting to really appreciate how much Django shielded me from much of the infrastructure setup for my applications.</p>

<p>FastAPI is unopinionated in things like the database, the connectors, authentication and models,
I find it difficult to gain expertise in any one area.  Thus, I am focusing on a smaller set of open source components that work with FastAPI so that I can gain a deeper understanding of how to use these components.</p>

<p>I feel that many other Python developers are on a similar journey to experiment more with asynchronous Python web applications.  I would appreciate feedback and ideas on which open source components or techniques to use to build effective asynchronous AI applications.</p>

and decided to test it using different procedures.</p>

<h2 id="first-impressions-putting-a-new-llm-to-the-test">First Impressions: Putting a New LLM to the Test</h2>

<p>My goal was to test its performance across a variety of tasks, from its raw speed and accuracy to its conversational memory. Here’s a look at how it performed.</p>

<h2 id="speed-and-versatility-the-bright-spots">Speed and Versatility: The Bright Spots</h2>

<p>Right away, I was impressed by the LLM’s results. It handled a diverse set of prompts, tackling controversial topics, generating specific coding examples, and even constructing travel plans around a given timeframe and location of interest. The speed was great, too. Most responses were generated in a quick 3 to 5 seconds.</p>

<p>The model also proved its accuracy in specific tasks. I tested its summarization ability with a short, four-sentence paragraph about the sun and asked it to condense it into a single sentence. It passed perfectly, creating one concise sentence that captured all the necessary information without losing accuracy.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-with-conversation-history-and-response-accuracy">Challenges with Conversation History and Response Accuracy</h2>

<p>While I enjoyed tinkering with the LLM, a prototype wouldn’t be a prototype without things it can improve on.</p>

<p>First, I noticed that response times weren’t always consistent. Some simple prompts took longer than expected (6-10 seconds), while, interestingly, some complex requests (e.g., debugging a recursive function) took around the same time a simple prompt would.</p>

<p>Second, during longer sessions, particularly after about 30 prompts, the model would sometimes run into errors and temporarily refuse to accept a new prompt. However, to my surprise, after a short 5-to-10-second wait, the LLM would again accept prompts as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>I also dug into its conversational memory (or at least I attempted to). My procedure was simple. First, I fed the LLM a simple fact: I told the LLM that my cat’s name is Kathy. Afterward, I would ask the LLM to write some simple code for minor tasks such as writing a sentence or printing a range of numbers.</p>

<p>My tests showed it could reliably remember the context of a conversation for up to 8 messages, but it struggled beyond that. Later, I tried again with more complex prompts. It could not remember the simple fact after 10, 20, or 30 messages, regardless of prompt complexity. This was even though I manually changed the message history limit through Visual Studio Code on my local machine.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, my experience with the AI Chat Assistant was very promising. It demonstrates a powerful and fast core capability while able to handle tasks with impressive detail. The occasional errors are expected of a prototype. Personally, they were no hindrance in assisting me with my daily activities. The foundation is clearly solid, and I’m excited to see how this LLM can help users accomplish more in a quick and cost-efficient manner.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ethan Luke Kim</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes on testing the FastOpp framework, including the essential git commands for contributing.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/assets/images/2025_10/blog-testing.webp" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/assets/images/2025_10/blog-testing.webp" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Architectural Consistency When Working with a PostgreSQL Async Database</title><link href="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/2025/10/07/postgresql-async/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Architectural Consistency When Working with a PostgreSQL Async Database" /><published>2025-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/2025/10/07/postgresql-async</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://oppkey.github.io/fastopp/2025/10/07/postgresql-async/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="postgresql-failing-with-async-in-production-although-sqlite-works-on-my-mac">PostgreSQL Failing with Async in Production Although SQLite Works on my Mac</h2>

<p>Last week, I was working on our FastOpp project and ran into a classic developer problem: “It works on my machine, but not in production.” Specifically, our FastAPI application worked perfectly with SQLite during development, but when I tried to switch to PostgreSQL in production on Leapcell using the Leapcell PostgreSQL service,
database access broke.</p>

<h2 id="converting-database-connection-to-sync-led-to-more-problems">Converting Database Connection to Sync Led to More Problems</h2>

<p>My first instinct was the same as many developers: find a workaround. I discovered that our
migration tool (Alembic) was trying to use synchronous database operations while our
FastAPI app was using asynchronous ones.</p>

<p>The “solution” I found online was to convert the database URL from async to sync during migrations:</p>

<p>I committed the solution after only testing it on SQLite locally and unfortunately forgot
to test it on PostgreSQL.  Several months passed and my laziness came back to bite
me and cost me many hours. As I am new to Alembic, I didn’t think about
async Alembic patterns. The logic of using synchronous calls for migrations seemed fine
to me as migrations <em>felt</em> synchronous.  I didn’t think about this mismatch in architectures
too deeply, shrugging it off as “the way things are.”</p>

<h2 id="the-real-problem-architectural-mismatch">The Real Problem: Architectural Mismatch</h2>

<p>Here’s what I learned: when you build an async application, try to keep as much of your code
as possible async. Although it is possible to “convert” async to sync in the middle of your stack,
it may cause problems in the future when you have to maintain your own code.</p>

<p>The issue wasn’t with the database or the migration tool. The issue was that I was trying to mix two different paradigms:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>My FastAPI app</strong>: Async throughout (using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncpg</code> for PostgreSQL)</li>
  <li><strong>My migrations</strong>: Sync operations (using sync database drivers)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-right-solution-go-all-in-on-async">The Right Solution: Go All-In on Async</h2>

<p>Instead of trying to convert between async and sync, I updated our migration system to be async from the ground up. Here’s the transformation:</p>

<h2 id="the-solution-pure-async-approach">The Solution: Pure Async Approach</h2>

<p>The key was updating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alembic/env.py</code> to use async patterns throughout:</p>

<h3 id="technical-implementation-details">Technical Implementation Details</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Added async imports</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncio</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Connection</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async_engine_from_config</code></li>
  <li><strong>Replaced sync patterns</strong> with async alembic template approach</li>
  <li><strong>Added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">do_run_migrations()</code></strong> function for connection handling</li>
  <li><strong>Added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_async_migrations()</code></strong> function for async engine management</li>
  <li><strong>Updated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_migrations_online()</code></strong> to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncio.run()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The key insight was this line:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">await</span> <span class="n">connection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">run_sync</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">do_run_migrations</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows you to run synchronous migration code within an async database connection.</p>

<h2 id="the-results-what-actually-happened">The Results: What Actually Happened</h2>

<p>After implementing the async approach, here’s what we achieved:</p>

<h3 id="single-driver-architecture"><strong>Single Driver Architecture</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Before</strong>: Needed both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncpg</code> (app) + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">psycopg2</code> (migrations)</li>
  <li><strong>After</strong>: Only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">asyncpg</code> for everything - no driver conflicts</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="consistent-database-urls"><strong>Consistent Database URLs</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Before</strong>: App used <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postgresql+asyncpg://</code> but migrations converted to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postgresql://</code></li>
  <li><strong>After</strong>: Both use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postgresql+asyncpg://</code> - same driver throughout</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benefits-of-the-async-approach">Benefits of the Async Approach</h2>

<h3 id="performance-benefits">Performance Benefits</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Async operations</strong> throughout the application</li>
  <li><strong>No sync/async context switching</strong> overhead</li>
  <li><strong>Better concurrency</strong> for database operations</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Single driver approach</strong> - no psycopg2 conflicts</li>
  <li><strong>Environment-based switching</strong> between SQLite and PostgreSQL</li>
  <li><strong>Modern async patterns</strong> following SQLAlchemy 2.0 best practices</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production-ready">Production Ready</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PostgreSQL support</strong> for production deployments</li>
  <li><strong>Async alembic migrations</strong> work with both databases</li>
  <li><strong>No breaking changes</strong> to existing SQLite development workflow</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-for-students">Why This Matters for Students</h2>

<p>If you’re learning web development, here’s the takeaway: <strong>consistency is more important than clever workarounds</strong>.</p>

<p>When you’re building modern web applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Choose your architecture (sync or async) and stick with it</li>
  <li>Don’t try to mix paradigms just because it seems easier</li>
  <li>The “quick fix” often becomes the “long-term problem”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="async-database-access-may-not-be-justified">Async Database Access May Not Be Justified</h2>

<p>Standardizing on synchronous database access for everything is simpler and will
work for most apps.  Asynchronous operations are needed only for heavy
SQL joins where the response takes many seconds or minutes and need to be run
in real-time.  In most cases, people will run the operation in the background
with Celery.</p>

<p>However, even if I don’t see the need for asynchronous database connections,
other people might.  FastOpp is a learning tool and I want to provide
asynchronous connectivity to support the creativity of others.</p>

<h2 id="the-business-lesson">The Business Lesson</h2>

<p>As a manager, I’ve seen this pattern play out in many projects. The “quick fix”
that saves 30 minutes today often costs hours or days later. In this case, spending the extra time to properly implement async migrations saved us from a maintenance nightmare. The “quick fix”
was also forgotten because there is no real-world impact in using synchronous migrations.</p>

<p>The modern approach - using async patterns throughout - is not just technically correct, it’s also more maintainable and scalable.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>

<p>Our FastOpp project now supports both SQLite (for development) and PostgreSQL (for production) with a single, consistent async architecture. No more driver conflicts, no more sync/async mixing, and no more “it works on my machine” problems.</p>

<p>It appears that <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/">psycopg3</a> supports both async and sync. I don’t think it’s as popular
as asyncpg.  However, I hope to try it out next.</p>

<h3 id="no-action-required"><strong>No Action Required</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SQLite development</strong> continues to work exactly as before</li>
  <li><strong>Optional</strong>: Update <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sqlite+aiosqlite://</code> for consistency</li>
  <li><strong>For PostgreSQL testing</strong>: Set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...</code></li>
